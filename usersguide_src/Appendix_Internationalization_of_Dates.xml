  <title>Internationalization of Dates
</title>
  <para>Currently, a date value sent to the database is converted into the yyyy-MM-dd format.  This is fine if you have configured your database to support this format but chances are, you may need to use a different format.  This format can now be set in the dbforms-config.xml file as follows:
</para>
  <para>
    <computeroutput>&lt;dbforms-config&gt;</computeroutput>
  </para>
  <para>
    <computeroutput>&lt;date-format&gt;dd/MM/yyyy&lt;/date-format&gt;</computeroutput>
  </para>
  <para>
    <computeroutput>&lt;table name=...</computeroutput>
  </para>
  <para>The format you specify, is the format in which you are expected to input your dates.  A conversion takes place within dbForms to convert your date value to the format expected by your database.  If you wish to DISPLAY dates in a format other then yyyy-MM-dd, then you are required to use the 'format' attribute as documented in the user manual.
