				DbForms v.1.1
				=============

TO DO
------

* Rendering of read-only html widgets (isReadOnly attribute in input tags)

* Possibility of selecting several items from a select box (Assigned to Eric Beaumier)

* Limit the select list (in query)to fields used in the body tag (useFieldsInBody attribute in form tag)

* Devise a technique (tag?) for 'populating' (without going to the server) a child select box, given a selection in the parent select box.

* Make the resultSetVector class more accessible.  Allow it to be cached and manipulated.

* Allow access to multiple databases.

* Generate DTD files for dbForms-config.xml and dbForms-errors.xml.

* Include support for DBCS. 

* Allow free-form queries (whereClause attribute in dbform tag) to be used in conjunction with DbForms navigation.

* On multiple-row updates, update only the rows for which fields have been modified.



If you wish to participate in the development of any of the above tasks, or have your own dbForms wish list.
