				DbForms v.1.0
				=============

TO DO
------

* Rendering of read-only html widgets (isReadOnly attribute in input tags)

* Possibility of selecting several items from a select box (multipleSelection attribute in Select tag)

* Limit the select list (in query)to fields used in the body tag (useFieldsInBody attribute in form tag)

* Allow to specify a display format for items in the select, checkbox and radio tags (format attribute)

* Support an upgrade to Poolman 2+ (Connection Pool Manager)

* Devise a technique (tag?) for 'populating' (without going to the server) a child select box, given a 
  selection in the parent select box.

* Make the resultSetVector class more accessible.  Allow it to be cached and manipulated.

* Allow access to multiple databases




If you wish to participate in the development of any of the above tasks, or have your own dbForms wish list.
