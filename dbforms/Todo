				DbForms v.1.1.3
				===============

TO DO
------

* Possibility of selecting several items from a select box.

* Limit the select list (in query)to fields used in the body tag (useFieldsInBody attribute in form tag)

* Devise a technique (tag?) for 'populating' a child select box, given a selection in the parent select box. (Assigned Eric Beaumier)

* Make the resultSetVector class more accessible.  Allow it to be cached and manipulated.

* Generate DTD files for dbForms-config.xml and dbForms-errors.xml.  (done in v.1.1.4)

* Include support for DBCS. 

* On multiple-row updates, update only the rows for which fields have been modified. (done in v.1.1.4)


If you wish to participate in the development of any of the above tasks, or have your own dbForms wish list.
