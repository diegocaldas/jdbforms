1) About this release
----------------------
This is a developers release, be careful to use this release in an
important production environment, but you are encouraged to try out this
release. Please report any problems or comments to the mailing list of
the project

    jdbforms-interest@lists.sourceforge.net

This documents summarizes the changes since last official release 1.1.2,
that are of interest to end users. There have also been several internal 
enhancements which are not mentioned here.

2) Compatibility Warnings
-------------------------
 The format attributes of tags queryData and tableData have  different
sementics now that are not 100% backwards compatible. See section below
for details.

Also, the insert button on previously generated list_and_single.jsp pages
will not appear unless the attribute showAlways="true" is added to the 
insertButtonTag. Otherwise, it will only appear in insert mode such as through a NavNewEvent.

4) Details about enhancements and changes:
------------------------------------------

4-0) DbForms and Tomcat 4.1.x taglib pooling
 --------------------------------------------

      Prior versions of DbForms should not be used with Tomcat 4.1.x
      with taglib pooling activated. This release should be usable with
      activated taglib pooling. 
      
4-1) Enhancements of dbforms-config.xml
---------------------------------------

4-1-1: Using of connection pooling is simplified.

        (Contributed by Luca Fossato)
        See documentation for further details.

4-1-2: Using of jdbc propertys is possible know.

        (Contributed by Henner Kollmann)
        See documentation for further details.

4-1-3: More flexible use of sql queries.

      (Contributed by Henner Kollmann)
      We introduce a new tag query to make the building of sql queries more flexible. 
      It's possible know to:
          - Create group by with flexible where part.
          - Create joined sql with a flexible join statement
          - Create an alias of an existing table
          - Make dynamic changes of the query which prevents the use of a view in the database.
       See documentation for further details.

4-1-4: Support for multiple databases connections within one application
      (initial contrib. by Brad Handy, further work by Luca Fossato and John Gagon)

      DbForms now has support for multiple databases within one application.
      See documentation for details.

4-1-5: New tags for foreign keys

      New tags 'foreign-key' and 'reference' have been introduced
      to be able to put foreign key information into the config file.
      These tags can also automatically be generated by DevGui.

      See documentation for details.

4-2) Taglib enhancements
 ------------------------

 4-2-1:  JavaScript Calendar support for dateField:
 
      supports now JavaScript Calendar written by
      Robert W. Husted to edit date fields. See pages
 
        http://developer.iplanet.com/viewsource/husted_calendar/husted_calendar.html
  
      and 

        http://jscal.sourceforge.net/

      for details of this application. Integration into dbforms stylesheets
      by Sebastian Bogaci.

      See also dbforms documentation about the calendar

 4-2-2: Support for printf style formatting to be used within
      tableData and queryData tags.

      (Contributed by Shawn Asamoto-Brown)
      This method uses a (free) class PrintfFormat taken from
      an article written by Allan Jacobs October 2000 about
      formatted printing within Java. It was published at:

       http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/sprintf/

      Example of usage within dbforms:

       <db:select fieldName="cust_id">
         <db:tableData
           foreignTable="customer"
           visibleFields="first_name,last_name,phone,cust_id"
           storeField="cust_id"
           name="custs"
           format="%s %s (Phone: %s, Cust-Id: %d)" />
       </db:select>

       or equivalent:

       <db:select fieldName="cust_id">
         <db:queryData
           query="select cust_id,first_name,last_name,phone,cust_id ascid from customer"
           name="custs"
           format="%s %s (Phone: %s, Cust-Id: %d)" />
       </db:select>

      Attention: This is not backwards compatible to old behaviour! 

 4-2-3: Extended search algorithm.

	(Contributed by Henner Kollmann)
      Know it is is possible to let dbforms automatically append % at beginning 
      and/or end of search string.  Furthermore dbforms can interpret the 
      search string and generate less then, greater then or between querys 
      depended on the input string.
      See new documentation for details.

 4-2-4: New tags for searching

	(Contributed by Henner Kollmann)      
	To simplify the generation of search stuff two new tags are introduced: search and searchCombo.
	You can use this tags instead of the complex searchFieldNames_, 
        searchFieldModeNames_ and searchFieldAlgorithmName_ 
        stuff. This tags will render all necessary fields!

 4-2-5: Possibility to choose between different database connections

       Several tags (DBForms, queryData, TableData, ...) have been extended to
       allow to choose between different database connections.

 4-3) Enhancements to XSL stylesheets
 -------------------------------------
 (all contrib. Sebastian Bogaci, special  thanks also for further help
and discussion)

    - More usage of extended stylesheet dbforms.css to make generated
      JSPs more configurable. A lot of attributes like color, background color,
      fonts etc. can now be easily changed at a central place.
      If you don't like the appearance of generated pages, it is now easy
      to change it.

    - Parameter multipart="true" is automatically set when fields of
      type 'blob', 'image' or 'diskblob' are detected within a table.

    - Made generated pages now really work when schema name
      is included in table name by substituting '.' in file and
      variable names by an '_'. Example: currentRow_schmema1.table1 is
      an illegal variable name in Java, must use currentRow_schmema1_table1

    - First integration of JavaScript Calendar written by
      Robert W. Husted to edit date fields. See above (dateField tag).
      The calender is not included in generated pages by default,
      activation can be done by setting a (new) checkbox within devgui
      on xsl transformation panel.

      See also dbforms documentation about the calendar

4-4) Enhancements to DevGui:
----------------------------

    - Automatic detection of auto-incremented (aka identity) fields
      for some databases (contrib. Sebastian Bogaci). This information
      is written to generated xml files by setting attribute autoInc="true".

      Currently we (hope to) have support for MySQL, DB2 (Sebastian) and
      Sybase (thanks to Eric Pugh). If you know how to add support for
      more systems, please send a mail to dbforms-interest mailing list.

    - New checkbox to include JavaScript calendar in JSPs generated by
      xsl transformations (see above).

    - New checkbox to write standard names for unknown field types to generated
      dbforms-config.xml file.

    - Now really fixed bug that could lead to problems when having tables
      with same name in different schemas.

    - Date format inside dbforms config file can now be set in DevGui.

    - Foreign Key support

    - Added Look & Feel Menu.

    - New Readme file for DevGui

 - DevGui can now be startet without Gui to regenerate a dbforms config file.
   This can be done from command line as well as from a running Java program.
   To do so, you have to:

     - create a property file containing connection information etc
       This may be done in a standard gui session of DevGui
     - call it via:

       java org.dbforms.devgui.DevGui createconfigfile <propertyfilename>

       or

       java org.dbforms.devgui.DevGui createconfigfile <propertyfilename> <outputfilename>

     Here is an example:

     $ java org.dbforms.devgui.DevGui createconfigfile /home/sweethome/dbex.props outout.xml

   If the outputfilename is not set on command line, it will be taken from
   property file. Normally the property file should be once generated in
   a gui session. It can later be used in command line sessions to regenerate
   the dbforms-config.xml file after changes to database.

   It is also possible to call the main() method of class DevGui from
   within a running java program like in

       String[] pars = {"createconfigfile","/home/sweethome/dbex.props"};
       org.dbforms.devgui.DevGui.main(pars);

   The other DevGui functionality (XSL transformation) can currently not be called
   via command line, maybe later.

     
4-5: Documentaion enhancements:
-------------------------------

4-5-1: The PDF Version of user guide has now clickable table of contents
               (Thanks to Richard Bondi for restructuring the document as well as for
                creating the PDF)
4-5-2: User Guide has several new sections written by various developers.
               (Thanks to Shawn Asamoto-Brown for bringing all of them into 
                the document and publishing the new versions)
4-5-3: Web pages included within release for easier navigation.
               Simply open directory  'doc/index.html' with your favourite browser
4-5-4: New taglib htmldocs with navigation frame to the left. Tags can be listed
               in semantic and alphabetic order. Can be found within doc/taglib directory.
4-5-5: New api javadoc. Can be found within doc/api directory.

4-6) Example Applications
-------------------------
Example Applications should now run with (included) hsqldb (http://hsqldb.sourceforge.net/).
It is still possible to other database systems.

4-7) Bug fixes
---------------

A lot of bug fixes have be done. See changes_1_1 for details.

4-8): JUnit Tests supported via Maven
---------------

4-8-1: 9 JUnit test cases have been written to test some of the peripheral functions of DBForms. These
			test cases allow developers to edit code, and if all the test cases pass, then to assume that
			the code is reliable and working.  Over time, this will help increase the stability of the DBForms
			codebase.  The test cases currently use the Maven (http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/maven) build 
			tool to provide the framework.  These testcases are ready to run out of the box.  If you have Maven
			installed, then just type 
				maven test
			and the testcases will be run.
4-8-2: 7 Cactus style incontainer test cases have been written.  These testcases test the more complex 
			functionality in DbForms that requires the support of a servlet container like Tomcat.  These also
			leverage maven for support and can be run by typing:
				maven cactus:test-tomcat-4x
4-8-3: Maven Support for Project Metrics.  Maven provides very comprehensive project statistics out of the 
			box based on the included project.xml file.  Some of these metrics include javadocs, source code 
			cross references, links to project tools, todo lists, test result reports, test coverage reports,
			and code metrics.  Just type
				maven site
			and you will see the site documentation be produced.
