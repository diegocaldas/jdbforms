list of common mistakes of DbForms-based development
========================================================


* forget to set isKey="true". every table needs at least 1 key, even if it's not defined in the 
  database


* forget to set sortable="true" in dbforms-config.xml, when using sorttags and orderBy clauses
  associated with that field
  

* forget to set autoInc="true", if a field is autoincremental (DbForms DevGui does not recognize
  that sometimes, therefore manual adaption is necessary in some cases.)


* forget to set multipart="true" in DbForm-tag, when using BLOB or DISKBLOBs
  

* insufficient classpath, especially log4j and jdbc drivers
  for using DevGui, you need XALAN in your classpath!
  if you are using XALAN-2 (recommended) then you need to add XALAN1COMPAT.jar to
  your classpath, too


* performance problems: do you refer to a pooled connection or to an "ordinary" connection in 
  dbforms-config.xml ?
  

* problem in linking to other JSP (GotoButton, followUp Attribute in dbForm-Tag)
  you must write a trailing slash "/", followed by the subdirectory, but you must _not_
  write the whole context name!
  

* mixing up dateLabel and dataLabel: 

  - dataLabel is a label which may contain a nested data-Tag like "tableData", "queryData"
    or "staticData" - this is used mostly to present mapped values of foreign keys 
    to the user in a convenient way.
    
  - dateLabel is a label which formats Date-fields
