list of common mistakes of DbForms-based development
========================================================
* using whereClause with filter and/or orderBy in dbform tag.  Filter and orderBy attributes will
  be ignored if whereClause used.  Either use a whereClause or use a Filter with (if necessary) orderBy.

* using whereClause in dbform tag and expecting navigation to work.  Although the navigation
  buttons will be rendered(should the be included on your jsp page) if you use a whereClause,
  Navigation will be unpredictable and so should not be used.  (Expected to change in the 1.4 release) 

* forget to set isKey="true". every table needs at least 1 key, even if it's not defined in the 
  database


* forget to set sortable="true" in dbforms-config.xml, when using sort tags and orderBy clauses
  associated with that field
  

* forget to set autoInc="true", if a field is autoincremental (DbForms DevGui does not recognize
  that sometimes, therefore manual adaption is necessary in some cases.)


* forget to set multipart="true" in DbForm-tag, when using BLOB or DISKBLOBs
  

* insufficient classpath, especially log4j and jdbc drivers
  for using DevGui, you need XALAN in your classpath!
  

* performance problems: do you refer to a pooled connection or to an "ordinary" connection in 
  dbforms-config.xml ?
  

* problem in linking to other JSP (GotoButton, followUp Attribute in dbForm-Tag)
  you must write a trailing slash "/", followed by the subdirectory, but you must _not_
  write the whole context name!
  

* mixing up dateLabel and dataLabel: 

  - dataLabel is a label which may contain a nested data-Tag like "tableData", "queryData"
    or "staticData" - this is used mostly to present mapped values of foreign keys 
    to the user in a convenient way.
    
  - dateLabel is a label which formats Date-fields
