<h3>Web Application Tab</h3>

<div align="center">
<img src="devgui1.png" width="369" height="232"  >
</div>

<ul>
<li> <strong>Location of Webapp:</strong> into this directory 
         DevGui will write the JSP files 
         generated by DevGui's 
        XSL transformations
<p><li> <strong>Web-URL of Webapp:</strong> URL which can be used
        to access the application
</ul>

<h3>Database Tab</h3>

<div align="center">
<img src="devgui2.png" width="369" height="232"  >
</div>


<ul>
<li> <strong>JDBC Driver Class: </strong> name of java class
      which implements java.sql.Driver and which will be
      used to connect to database. Examples:             
     <ul>
      <li> com.databasename.jdbc.Driver
      <li> org.freedb.jdbc.type4driver.MainDriver
     </ul>
     See your driver's documentation.
<p><li> <strong>JDBC URL: </strong> URL to connect to database.
      Refer to driver documentation.
      Examples:
    <ul>
      <li> jdbc:foo:bar://host123:876/myveryimportantdb
      <li> jdbc:abcd://host2.dom1.dom2.dom3/database=db3;option1=yes
    </ul>
<p><li> <strong>Username: </strong>Username for DB connection
<p><li> <strong>Password: </strong>Password for DB connection
<p><li> <strong>Test Connection button: </strong> Can (and should) be used
       to check if above entries are ok.
</ul>
<h3>XML Config Tab</h3>

<div align="center">
<img src="devgui3.png" width="369" height="232"  >

</div>

<ul>
<li> <strong>DbForms-Config File: </strong> Name of XML file which
       contains config for dbforms. An initial version of this file can be automatically
        generated by DevGui by reading meta data from database. 
        This file is also used as input for XSL transfortations
        in tab 'XSL Transformation'.<p>
      
        Filename should be something like:<br>

       &lt;location-of-webapp&gt;/WEB-INF/dbforms-config.xml
<p><li> <strong>Examine tables, views, system tables checkboxes: </strong>
       Allows to select which for which table types table
       descriptions should be generated into config file. 
<p><li> <strong>Catalog name filter</strong>: It depends on the database
     system, whether it supports catalogs  and how it maps this
     general term to a database specific term. Often a catalog is mapped
     to 'database'.
     <p>
     The easiest thing is always to select 'all catalogs', but if needed, you may
     try to restrict the set of examined tables by entering
      a catalog name and selecting the corresponding
     radio button.
    <p>
     Be aware that several database systems that map 'catalog' to
     'database' do not allow to read information about
     tables in another database than that one you are currently connected to.
<p><li> <strong>Schema filter</strong>: It depends on the database
     system, whether it supports schemas and how it maps this 
     general terms to a specific term. Often a
     schema is mapped to 'table owner'. 
     <p>
     The easiest thing is always to select radio button 
     'all schemas', but if needed, you may
     try to restrict the set of examined tables by entering
      a schema name pattern and selectiong the corresponding 
     radio button. 
    <p>While you always have to enter
       a complete catalog name into combo box for catalog name,
       field for schema name may contain
       a schema pattern with '%' as pattern for an arbitrary (maybe empty)
       string. Examples:
     <ul>
      <li> 'foo%' would select all tables in a
       schema with a name that begins with substring 'foo'.
      <li> '%nix%' would select all tables in a schema with a name that 
             contains a substring 'nix'.
     </ul>

<p><li> <strong>'Load' button: </strong> You can try to load the set of available catalog and schema
     names into the corresponding combo boxes by clicking the
     'Load' button. You must have the database tab completed before.
<p><li> <strong>Table name filter: </strong> Via radio buttons and
       textfield you can select tables with arbitrary names or 
       with a name that matches a certain name pattern. See comments
       about patterns above.
<p><li> <strong>Use autocommit mode: </strong> Should normally be checked, was 
       inserted as a workaround for a bug of a special driver.
<p><li> <strong>Include catalog or table name: </strong> If checked, DevGui 
      tries to include catalog and/or schema name in generated
      xml file like 'admin.table1' instead of just 'table1'.
<p><li> <strong>Generate XML button: </strong>DevGui tries to read database meta data
      and generated a dbforms config in XML format. Result is shown
      in editor pane.
<p><li> <strong>Save File: </strong>Save config in editor pane to dbforms config file.
</ul>
  
       
<h3>XSL Transformation</h3>

<div align="center">
<img src="devgui4.png" width="369" height="232"  >

</div>

<ul><li>
This tab can be used to automatically generate 
Java Server Pages that use DbForms taglib by applying
XSL stylesheets to dbforms config file. To do that,
you must have generated (or loaded) a dbforms config file,
then you mark the name of a style sheet and
select button 'start transformation'. 
<p><li>Generated pages are written to the web application directory.
</ul>
