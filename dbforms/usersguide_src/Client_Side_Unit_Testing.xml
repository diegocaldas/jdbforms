three example test cases.</emphasis></para>

<para>To generate own unit tests you can use the new maven task <computeroutput>maxq</computeroutput>. This task
first starts tomcat as application server and second starts maxq as recorder
of your web pages. Only thing you must do to use the recorder is to set your
<computeroutput>proxyport</computeroutput> to <computeroutput>localhost:8090</computeroutput> so that all request can be proxied by maxq.
