      shows the interaction between the Controller class that receives the incoming

              The EventEngine, invoked by the Controller servlet, parses a request to find out
              which event(s) need to be instanciated.
              The fine-grained parsing (parsing of additional data, etc) is done
              by the WebEvent-Object itself (in order to hide complexity from this
              class and to keep the framework open for implementations of new Event-classes)
