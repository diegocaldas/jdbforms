2-4) new integration of jasperreports with dbforms
----------------------------------------------------
There is a new servlet to generate a jasperreport with the data from an dbform.
    taken from api doc:
    	This servlet starts a JasperReport.
	Data is read from the current dbForm.
	Servlet is looking for the report xml file in WEB-INF/custom/reports, WEB-INF/reports.
	If report xml is newer then jasper file report will be recompiled.
	Data is send to report as JRDataSourceRSV which is a Wrapper around an ResultSetVector.
	To enable subreports, message resources etc an ReportParameter is send to the JasperReport. 
	usage:
		with a simple goto button:
			<db:gotoButton
				destTable="web_parts"
				destination=" /reports/Artikel"/>
		or for one record:
			<db:gotoButton
				destTable="web_parts"
				keyToDestPos="currentRow"
				destination="/reports/Artikel"
			/>
	Servlet mapping must be set to handle all /reports by this servlet!!!
