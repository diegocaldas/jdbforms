======================================================================================================

1)    About this release
-------------------------
DbForms 2.3 is a bug fix of version 2.2.
Please have a look into the release notes of version 2.0 for more details!

2-1)  bug fix of navigation problem
------------------------------------
Up to version 2.2 there was a navigation problem in updating subforms. This is fixed now.

2-2) Added support for parameters in Interceptors
-------------------------------------------------
Added support for parameters in Interceptors. Interceptor implementations may retrieve
a Map containing parameters via the getParams() method. 

2-3) New BLOB handling
-----------------------
1. New default way of BLOB handling:
on upload, files will be directly stored in the database, no Java wrapper object is used
anymore. The Java wrapper object (FileHolder) was stored in the DB in previous versions 
to retain meta-information about the file (most importantly, its file name) However, this
yielded serious issues (e.g. Deserialization-problems and the inability of non-DBForms /
non-Java applications to access the BLOBs).

Therefore, DbForms stores files now directly as BLOBs, without any wrapper objects.
To make sure that the file name information is not lost, you can install the Interceptor
org.dbforms.eventBlobInterceptor inside the respective table/query element in dbforms-config.
As the example below shows, the interceptor uses two arguments "blob-column" and 
"name-column" to tell the system where to store the file and where to store its name.
(The incerceptor works onInsert and onUpdate)
   
<table ...>
		<interceptor className="org.dbforms.event.BlobInterceptor">
		  <param name="blob-column" value="myfile"/>
		  <param name="name-column" value="myfilename"/>			
		</interceptor>
</table>
	
If the table/query has several BLOBs that need to be processed by the interceptor, you
can simply append numbers to the parameter names (e.g. "blob-column1", "name-column1",
"blob-column2", "name-column2", ...)
 
If you want or need to use the BLOB handling as provided by earlier verions , you need to 
manually switch back to "classic" mode by adding the an attribute "blobHandling" with
value "classic" to your table/query defintion in dbforms-config.xml:

<table blobHandling="classic">
  <!-- table where BLOBs should be stored as FileHolders -->
</table> 

2-4) Added an optional parameter "nameField" to the blobURL-Tag
---------------------------------------------------------------
Added an optional parameter "nameField" to the blobURL-Tag (org.dbforms.tablib.DbBlobUrlTag)
The blobURL tag renders an HTML hyperlink which - when clicked - triggers a file download. To 
provide the FileServlet (which handles the download) with the necessary filename info, we send
it the name of the column where it can look up the name of the file to be returned. In case of
the  example above, we  would specify <db:blobURL fieldName="file" nameField="fileName"/>
 
2-5)  changed from cos.jar to commons-fileupload.jar
----------------------------------------------------
Removed dependency from cos.jar to commons-fileupload.jar from the jakarta apache group.
Usage of cos.jar is prohibited in commercial projects, usage of the jakarta commons lib not.


2-6) Added possibility to put null values into the database for string fields
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The special value [NULL] in string fields is parsed now and stored as null value into the database.

2-7)  Added new tag HasRecordsTag
---------------------------------
This new tag is the opposite of HasNoRecordsTag. It's contents will be rendered if the resultset 
contains data.

2)    Details about enhancements and changes
2-1)  added setDataSource Tag

1) About this release
----------------------

DbForms 2.2 is just a bug fix of version 2.0 and contains no new features. 
Please have a look into the release notes of version 2.0 for more details!

2-1)  added setDataSource Tag
------------------------------
Added a new Tag to use with the jstl sql tags: <db:setDataSource />. 
This tags adds a DataSource retrieved from the dbforms connection pool to the 
page context.
So the connections configured inside dbforms could be used within the 
jstl sql tags.

1) About this release
----------------------

DbForms 2.0 is the second release to be labelled production/stable. It is the result of the 1.1.4 developer 
releases.  Changes made in those releases are included and described below.

Please report any problems or comments to the DbForms mailing list:

    jdbforms-interest@lists.sourceforge.net

This document summarizes the changes since release 1.1.3, which are of interest to end users. Note that their have 
also been several internal enhancements to DbForms which are documented uniquely within the source code(i.e.: code 
cleanup, improved algorithms).

2) Compatibility Issues
-------------------------

2-1) Interceptor interface
-----------------------------------

To have better control over the fields written to the database, the interceptor interface for methods 
preUpdate/preInsert/preDelete have been modified to:

      public int preXXXXXX(
      				HttpServletRequest request,  
					Table table, 
					FieldValues fieldValues,
					DbFormsConfig config, 
					Connection con) throws ValidationException

You now have full control over the fields written to the database, and can remove, change and add new fields by 
simply modifying the FieldValues object.

IMPORTANT: You must change all (call-back) methods in your interceptors to use this new signature. Changing the 
code however, is not necessary because the interface of class FieldValues is compatible to that of class Hashtable.


2-2) FilterCondition Tag
-----------------------------------

Changed filters to use the resultSet setter methods. Quotes ('') should no longer be added to string-type 
filter conditions. This is now added automatically.

Example:
 
	name like '?' 
	
		becomes

	name like ? 


2-3) ValidationException classes
---------------------------------------

To break cyclic references, the classes 

	org/dbforms/event/ValidationException and 
	org/dbforms/event/MultipleValidationException

have been moved to

	org/dbforms/config/ValidationException
	org/dbforms/config/MultipleValidationException



3)   Details about enhancements and changes
-------------------------------------------

3-0) Code cleanup
-----------------

A major cleanup has been done to change the navigation system and to remove duplicated code inside the tag libraries.
This cleanup should not affect any interfaces, however a lot of classes have been touched. So please report all 
irregularities to the mailing list!


3-1) New navigation framework
-----------------------------

A new event framework has been built that DOES NOT re-execute a search query every time a client requests an 
additional subset of data (as the original did). Also, with this framework, it is possible to use navigation in 
conjunction with free form selects (as navigation has been made independent of filtering).

Please refer to the Users Guide for details on how to use and configure the previous "classic" system if desired 
(the new navigation framework (dataList) is now the default).

3-2) XML data source
----------------------

A new event framework was also put into place with this new DbForms release.  To demonstrate its usefulness, 
a data source to read XML data was developed. Please refer to the Users Guide and bookstore example for more 
details.

3-3) Bookstore example application
----------------------------------

Added a new example application named bookstore to show several of DbForms more advanced features. This web 
application contains some helpful to-do example pages and is also used for testing purposes.

Another goal in developing the bookstore application was to have a common application base for all DbForms 
developers. In the event of a reported bug, a simple page could be built in the bookstore application 
exemplifying the bug and allowing for easy debugging by DbForms developers.

3-4) New field type TIME
------------------------

DbForms now supports SQL time as a valid field type.


3-5) Text field output
----------------------

Input (text) fields now provide the 'pattern' attribute which is used to specify display format. Internally, 
this is achieved by passing the desired format to the format.applyPattern method. The format is constructed from 
the locale setting found in the current request object. So, numeric and date values are written with user-defined 
locale.

IMPORTANT: The format attribute is now deprecated

Another important change is how null values (from the database) are displayed. You can set a substitute 'null 
field value' with the 'null field' attribute.  Default value can also be specified using the 'default' attribute.


3-6) Text field parsing
-------------------------------------

Parsing text is not done according to the current locale setting and format pattern. To enable, the format used 
to write out the field is written as a hidden field into the page.  During parsing, it is read back and used to 
construct a format for parsing. Numeric and date values are then parsed according to the end-user locale setting.

3-7) Deprecated: date-format attribute in dbforms-config.xml 
--------------------------------------------------------------

Due to the above-mentioned changes in output and parsing date input fields, the date-format attribute 
(dbforms-config.xml) has become obsolete and should no longer be used.

3-8) jUnit testing of client side code
------------------------------------------

Integrated httpclient and maxq into the package. It is now possible to run the maxq recorder, generate junit 
test files for the client side and test the results during unit testing.

Added some general tests for displaying and editing data. 


3-9) Added attribute searchAlgo to filterValue tag
--------------------------------------------------

Added the searchAlgo attribute to the filterValue tag with values of

	sharp 			this is the default behaviour, do nothing.
	weakStart		like, % is added in front of value
	weakEnd			like, % is appended to value
	weakStartEnd	like, % is added in front of value and % is appended to value

For more details see documentation.

3-10) Added the possibility to use StaticDataItem - Tags inside TableData, QueryData and ConfTableData
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now you can add StaticDataItem - Tags inside TableData, QueryData and ConfTableData. So it's possible to
add fixed values to your list of dynamic values.

3-11) Change tableName at runtime
----------------------------------
Now you can change the tableName at runtime. So it's possible to change the table and reuse the form.
One consequence of this is that in the case you use this features the well known dbforms variables, 
e.g. currentRow_tablename will not work. So i added a new variable named dbforms as hashtable. 
This hashtable holds a list of all known dbforms and subforms in the page. 
Key of the map is the new db:dbforms attribute name. 
Objects of this list are of the type DbFormContext, 
which will give the access to all of the known fields:

Public class DbFormsContext {
	public String getPosition();
	public ResultSetVector getRsv();
	public Map getSearchFieldAlgorithmNames();
	public Map getSearchFieldModeNames();
	public Map getSearchFieldNames();
	public Map getCurrentRow();
	public void setCurrentRow(Map map);
	public void setPosition(String string);
}
