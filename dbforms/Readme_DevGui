RUNNING THE DevGui tool
============================

0. What is it?

  DevGui is a swing application that can
  
  - automatically create a first dbforms-config.xml for your
    database by reading the meta data about tables and columns
    inside your database
  
  - create JSPs that use the dbforms taglib by applying 
    XSL transformations to the config file. So you have a running
    web application for your database without having written a 
    single line of code.
  
  More documentation about DevGui can be found in
  
    http://www.dbforms.org/docs/articles/DbForms_DevGui.pdf
    http://www.dbforms.org/docs/articles/XSL_DbForms.pdf
  
  Both PDF articles are still worth reading, because they descibe 
  ideas and principles behind DevGui. Included information about
  needed libraries or user interface is partially out of date, so 
  please read on this file about how to install and run the application 
  and refer also to HTML file
  
    doc/html/devgui.html
  
  inside dbforms distribution about using the current user interface.

1. prerequisites:

a. Download and install a Java2 (version 1.2 or later) Java Development Kit
   Kit implementation for your operating system platform.  Define an environment
   variable JAVA_HOME that points at the base directory of your JDK
   installation, and add the directory "$JAVA_HOME/bin" to your PATH variable.

b. Extract the DbForms distribution to a directory.
   for example "h:\dbforms" on a Win32 system or 
   /home/user123/dbforms on a *nix system.
  
   you should have a (similiar) directory structure as follows:
  
   h:\dbforms\bin\
   h:\dbforms\etc\
   h:\dbforms\example\
   h:\dbforms\dist\
   h:\dbforms\misc\
   h:\dbforms\src\
   h:\dbforms\temp\
   h:\dbforms\xsl-stysheets\

c. Set an environment variable named "DBFORMS_HOME" which points to
   the directory containing the dbforms distribution:
  
   DBFORMS_HOME=h:\dbforms
  
   the exact command to use depends on your operation system:
   - on Win32, you can type: SET DBFORMS_HOME=h:\dbforms or you can use the system
     configuration panel.
   - on Unix, you can use the SETENV or EXPORT command, depending on your shell:

     csh,tcsh:  setenv DBFORMS_HOME /home/user123/dbforms (csh,tcsh)
  
     sh      :  DBFORMS_HOME=/home/user123/dbforms 
                export DBFORMS_HOME
  
     bash,ksh:  export DBFORMS_HOME=/home/user123/dbforms


d. Required additional libraries:

   DevGui is a simple Swing application, not a Web Application, so 
   you do not need a Servlet or JSP container like tomcat to run it. 
   These containers are later needed to run a dbforms web application
   that is generated in parts by DevGui. So you just need:

   a) a JDBC driver for your DBMS in your CLASSPATH.
      You will later also need this driver inside the running
      web application. 

   b) libraries for Xalan-Java XSLT processor and a XML parser
      like Xerxes. Please download simply a binary xalan distribution 
      from 

      http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/

      and include xalan.jar and xercesImpl.jar (both included) 
      in your CLASSPATH.

   example (win):

     set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;x:\where\ever\it\is\my_jdbc_driver.jar
     set XALANLIBDIR=x:\javastuff\xalan-j_2_3_1\bin
     set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;%XALANLIBDIR%\xalan.jar;%XALANLIBDIR%\xercesImpl.jar

   example (bash):

     export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/where/ever/it/is/my_jdbc_driver.jar
     export XALANLIBDIR=/home/user123/xalan-j_2_3_1/bin
     export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$XALANLIBDIR/xalan.jar:$XALANLIBDIR/xercesImpl.jar

   You must include these libs in CLASSPATH, it helps not having it in your 
   web-applications classpath, because DevGui runs outside the Servlet container!
      
2. start the shell script in $DBFORMS_HOME/dbforms/bin:

    devgui.bat (win32)
    devgui.sh  (unix,linux)
      
3. the SWING-based GUI should appear now. (enjoy!)

   Some documentation about using DevGui can be found 
   within file doc/html/devgui.html

4. Before using the generated application, you have to copy
   the stylesheet file dbforms.css and the dbformslib directory
   (both can be found within misc directory)
   to your web application. The dbformslib directory contains
   a subdirectory containing two icons and another subdirectory
   with the Javascript calendar application.


ALTERNATIVE METHOD OF RUNNING DEVGUI VIA ANT

If you already have Ant installed, and are comfortable with tweaking build.xml files
then you can use the <devgui> target.  The DBFORMS_HOME directory will default to your current
location of DbForms.  Make sure however that you have generated the DbForms jar by running the
<jar_classes> target.  You will also need to place your JDBC drivers in your ant/lib directory,
or tweak the build.xml to include where your JDBC drivers are.

1. ant <jar_classes>

2. ant <devgui>

About the included JavaScript Calendar:

DbForms contains JavaScript Calendar written by
Robert W. Husted (rhusted@requisite.com) 
with friendly permission of author. See 
http://developer.iplanet.com/viewsource/husted_calendar/husted_calendar.html
for more information about this tool. The calendar
is now developed as open source project 'jscal' with
homepage at http://jscal.sourceforge.net/. 

Integration into dbforms xsl stylesheets by Sebastian Bogaci.

To use the calendar within your application, you have to 
copy the files and directories that you find within the
dbforms misc directory into your web application.
