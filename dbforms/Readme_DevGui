RUNNING THE DevGui tool
============================

0. prerequisites: all prerequisites listed in file "README";

   additionally following prerequisites are required:
   
   * you should make the latest version of apache XALAN available in your CLASSPATH
     (-> http://xml.apache.org/xalan/index.html)     
   * you should have the JDBC driver class of your Database in your CLASSPATH 
   (it helps not having it in your web-applications classpath, because 
   DevGui runs outside the Servlet container!)
   

1. extract the DbForms distribution to a directory.
   for example "h:\dbforms-0.9" on a Win32 system
   
   you should have a (similiar) directory structure as follows:
   
   h:\dbforms-0.9\bin\
   h:\dbforms-0.9\example\
   h:\dbforms-0.9\lib\
   h:\dbforms-0.9\src\
   h:\dbforms-0.9\temp\   
   h:\dbforms-0.9\xml-stysheets\
      
2. Set an environment variable named "DBFORMS_HOME" which points to 
   the directory containing the dbforms distribution:
   
   DBFORMS_HOME=h:\dbforms-0.9
   
   the exact command to use depends on your operation system:
   - on Win32, you can type: SET DBFORMS_HOME=h:\dbforms-0.9 or you can use the system 
     configuration panel.     
   - on Unix, you can use the SETENV command
   


3. start the shell script in you find in {$install-drive}\dbforms-0.9\bin\:

	devgui.bat (win32)
	devgui.sh (unix - not tested yet, please send feedback if it works for you or not)
	

4. the SWING-based GUI should appear now. (enjoy!)
