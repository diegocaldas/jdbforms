2-1)  Changes to the tag library
---------------------------------


2-1-1) New attribute overrideFieldCheck for db:dbform tag
---------------------------------------------------------
If set to true the field values will not be checked if they are changed.
The database update will be done always.
This could be usefull if you want to call your interceptor always to 
check fields which are not part of the table.
In your interceptor you can use return DbEventInterceptor.IGNORE_OPERATION 
if you do not want the database update 


2-1-2) Added title attribute to tags
------------------------------------
You can know use the title attribute for all tags. So tooltips can be supported for IE.

2-1-3) Added country support for locale
---------------------------------------
Know also the country attribut is used in locales

2-1-4) Added autocomplete attribute to dbforms tag
--------------------------------------------------
If the autocomplete value is specified then the attribute is inserted in the form tag. 
if the value is "off" and if the browser has autocompletion ability, it can be disabled with this tag. 
Any value will be accepted for autocomplete. e.g. autocomplete="any", 
the generated HTML code is: <form name="dbforms" ... autocomplete="any" ... >

2-1-5) Changed autoupdate attribute of dbforms tag
--------------------------------------------------
If set to "true", at every action (navigation, insert, update, etc.) all input fields of ALL currently rendered rowsets are parsed and updated. 
if set to "OnUpdateOnly", updates are only performed if an explicite "update"- action is launched 
(normally by hitting the updateAction-button)

2-1-6) New attribute compareWith for SearchCombo
------------------------------------------------
If set to "index" the index value will be used to compare against the selected value.
If set to "value" the value value will be used to compare against the selected value.
If set to "list" the index of the list will be used to compare against the selected value
default is "index".


2-1-7) Added tag DbSearchCheckBox
---------------------------------
This tag will render a checkbox with a dedicated value for searching


2-2)  Changes to configuration
--------------------------------

2-2-1) Added contextDataSource as attribute to dbconnection tag in config file
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With the contextDataSource attribute you can use existing DataSource-Object from
servlet-context-scope (e.g. from struts-config.xml):
you just have to add a "contextDataSource" property to dbforms-config.xml
with the name of the scoped-Variable.

2-2-2) Added global interceptor to dbforms-config.xml
-----------------------------------------------------
You can add an global interceptors now:
<dbforms-config>
	<interceptors>
	   <interceptor>
	      <param/>
	   </interceptor>
       	</interceptors>
</dbforms-config>
The interceptor tag has the same attributes as the interceptor tag inside the 
table attribute!
