<h1>DbForms</h1>
Rapid Database Application Development

<p><b>Features List</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Nested database forms (arbitrary deep nesting)
<li>Custom tag library for many kinds of data input- and presentation-widgets
<li>Custom tag library for many kinds of action-buttons (navigation, insert, delete, update, new, search, …)
<li>Built in sorting support
<li>Built in searching support
<li>Built in row filtering support
<li>Built in Blob support
<li>Built in "Diskblob" support (substitution of a databases' BLOB capability by storing files on the file system instead)
<li>Automatic re-repopulating input fields
<li>Automatic updating of multiple rows with only 1 submit
<li>Styling tags
<li>Multi + concurrent user support
<li>Complete flexibility, as all DbForms-views are just usual JSP files. No preprocessing, no dubious code generation. Just keep on using your favorite HTML/JSP editing tools!
<li>Security (support of role-based permission granting)
<li>Scalability (support of database connection pools, no (known) bottlenecks in DbForms architecture, no constraints on database- or table-size)
<li>Support for scripting independently from the custom tag library (through JSP TEIs)
<li>API for programming
<ul>
<li>application hookups (database event listeners) to interoperate with virtual any other components (EJBs, Servlets, Struts applications, Legacy Systems, etc.)  available to the web-application
<li>background database operations (transaction logs, etc)
<li>individual serverside (input-)data validators
</ul>
<li>Configuration completely XML based (+ tool for automatic generation of the XML configuration file)
<li>SWING based user interface for more efficient RAD!
<li>Pure Java, Open source
</ul>
