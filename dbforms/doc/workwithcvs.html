<h1>Working with the CVS</h1>

<p>
The complete source code of all DbForms libraries and examples is now available on the CVS (current versioning system) at <a href="http://sourceforge.net">sourceforge.net</a>. - In case you do not know how to download sources from CVS, please read <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=763&group_id=1">sourceforge's site docu</a> - this docu contains lots of useful information
</p>


<h3>How to fetch files anonymously from server:</h3>

<p>
create a local directory, e.g. "dbforms", on your local harddisk
</p>


type the following to log-in:
<pre>
       cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.jdbforms.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jdbforms login
</pre>
and then fetch the files::
<pre>
       cvs -z8 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.jdbforms.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jdbforms co dbforms
</pre>


Now you should retrieve all the DbForms source files and libraries

<h3>How to build DbFroms from source:</h3>

<b>Prerequisites: </b>
<ul>
<li>you should have <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java 1.3</a> installed on your system
<li>you should have set the environment variable "JAVA_HOME" pointing to the root directory of that installation (e.g. "c:\jdk1.3.1" on a windows system)
<li>you should have installed <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/">Jakarta Ant</a> on your system
</ul>

if these prerequisites are given, you only need to
<ul>
<li>change to your local &quot;dbforms&quot;-directory, which you created via CVS.
<li>type in "ant"
</ul>
...that's it!

<p>
<b>Results:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>a .jar file containing the DbForms library
<li>a .war file for each sample app in directory /dist
</ul>

<p>Deploy the .war files to your Servlet 2.2+ compatible servlet container!
If you are not using MySql, you have to edit the dbforms-config.xml file to set up the database connection
properly. And of course, do not forget to create the test-databases according to the *.sql files in /examples directory</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>
