(contrib. by <a href="mailto:mark.dimon@btinternet.com">Mark Dimon</a>)<br>
 XSL stylesheet performs a merge of the config file generated by DevGui
with a similar overaly file , this way you can force certain fields to be
set , ie usfull for isKey in mysql and any other attributes / elements which
are needed in the config but not actually generated.
