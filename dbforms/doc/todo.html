	<li>Automatic generation of client side JavaScript code for form-field validation (checking datatypes and maybe other constraints at data-input or form-submit-time) (serverside validation done in 0.8 - by application hookups)
	<li>Elimination of the restriction to "mid-sized" databases. (done in 0.7)	Providing support for File-Upload (in different flavours, one of them will be of course BLOB - support) (done in 0.6)
	<li>A final DTD for "dbforms-config.xml", with no more restriction to only one database per application
	<li>A second Custom Tag Library, only for styling purposes (first try done in 0.7, but still under development)
	<li>A configurable logging facility (done in 0.9)
	<li>Bug fixes: most bugs fixed, in every new release there is a risk of  new ones to appear
	<li>Integration of server-side hookups where other applications (for instance Jakarta-Struts-apps) or application components (for instance EJB session beans) may register themselves for receiving DbForms-events (done in 0.8)
</ul>
