<h3>XML Config Tab</h3>

<div align="center">
<a href="devgui3.png"><img src="devgui3.png" width="369" height="232"  ></a>

</div>

<ul>
<li> <strong>DbForms-Config File: </strong> Name of XML file which contains config for dbforms. An initial version of this file can be automatically generated by DevGui by reading meta data from the database. This file is also used as input for XSL transfortations in tab 'XSL Transformation'.
    <p>

        Filename should be something like:<br>

       &lt;location-of-webapp&gt;/WEB-INF/dbforms-config.xml
<p><li> <strong>Examine tables, views, system tables checkboxes: </strong> Allows to select for which table types, table descriptions should be generated into config file.
    <p><li> <strong>Catalog name filter</strong>: It depends on the database system, whether it supports catalogs and how it maps this general term to a database specific term. Often a catalog is mapped to a 'database'.
    <p>
     The easiest thing is always to select 'all catalogs', but if needed, you may
     try to restrict the set of examined tables by entering
      a catalog name and selecting the corresponding
     radio button.
    <p>
     Be aware that several database systems that map 'catalog' to
     'database' do not allow to read information about
     tables in another database than that one you are currently connected to.
<p><li> <strong>Schema filter</strong>: It depends on the database
     system, whether it supports schemas and how it maps this
     general terms to a specific term. Often a
     schema is mapped to 'table owner'.
     <p>
     The easiest thing is always to select radio button
     'all schemas', but if needed, you may
     try to restrict the set of examined tables by entering
      a schema name pattern and selectiong the corresponding
     radio button.
    <p>While you always have to enter
       a complete catalog name into combo box for catalog name,
       field for schema name may contain
       a schema pattern with '%' as pattern for an arbitrary (maybe empty)
       string. Examples:
     <ul>
      <li> 'foo%' would select all tables in a
       schema with a name that begins with substring 'foo'.
      <li> '%nix%' would select all tables in a schema with a name that
             contains a substring 'nix'.
     </ul>

<p><li> <strong>'Load' button: </strong> You can try to load the set of available catalog and schema
     names into the corresponding combo boxes by clicking the
     'Load' button. You must have the database tab completed before.
<p><li> <strong>Table name filter: </strong> Via radio buttons and
       textfield you can select tables with arbitrary names or
       with a name that matches a certain name pattern. See comments
       about patterns above.
<p><li> <strong>Use autocommit mode: </strong> Should normally be checked, was
       inserted as a workaround for a bug of a special driver.
<p><li> <strong>Write standard type names for unknown field types:</strong>
       If not checked, DevGui will write the names for column types
       exactly as it gets them from the database. Sometimes this may lead
       to problems, if the DBMS uses a type that could be handled by dbforms
       but is has an unknown specific name. E.g. there are a lot of different
       names for various 'integer' types. If this option is checked, DevGui
       will try to write standard name for all unknown types into the
       generated dbforms config file.
<p><li> <strong>Foreign key detection:</strong> Devgui can use meta data 
methods to determine foreign key relationships between tables and write
corresponding tags into the generated config file. This can surely only work if the
used database system as well as the JDBC driver supports this feature. You have
two alternative method available:
<ul>
<li> Using method getImportedKeys() within a loop<br>
    This should always work and is default
<li> using method getCrossReferences() once<br>
    This might not work with all databases, but if it does, it will probably
     be much faster than the first method above. Simply try it out!
</ul>
You can also deactivate foreign key detection. 
<p><li> <strong>Include catalog or table name: </strong> If checked, DevGui
      tries to include catalog and/or schema name in generated
      xml file like 'admin.table1' instead of just 'table1'.
<p><li> <strong>Set date format to:  </strong>Here you may select or enter
      a date pattern that then will be set as default date format within
      dbforms config file using tag date-format.
<p><li> <strong>Generate XML button: </strong>DevGui tries to read database meta data
      and generated a dbforms config in XML format. Result is shown
      in editor pane.
<p><li> <strong>Save File: </strong>Save config in editor pane to dbforms config file.
</ul>


<h3>XSL Transformation</h3>

<div align="center">
<a href="devgui4.png"><img src="devgui4.png" width="369" height="232"  ></a>

</div>
This tab can be used to automatically generate
Java Server Pages that use DbForms taglib by applying
XSL stylesheets to dbforms config file. To do that,
you must have generated (or loaded) a dbforms config file,
then you mark the name of a style sheet and
select button 'start transformation'.

<ul>
<li> <strong>Stylesheet Directory: </strong> Location of the directory that contains your stylesheets that you wish to use.
    <p>

        Defaults to:<br>

       &lt;DBFORMS_HOME&gt;/xsl-stylesheets/
       <P>
<li> <strong>Use JavaScript Calendar: </strong> If checked, the generated
   pages will include a JavaScript calendar written by Robert W. Husted for editing of
   date fields. Calendar is included in dbforms with friendly permission of author.
   See
<a href="http://developer.iplanet.com/viewsource/husted_calendar/husted_calendar.html">http://developer.iplanet.com/viewsource/husted_calendar/husted_calendar.html</a>
for more information about this tool. The calendar
is now developed as open source project 'jscal' with
homepage at <a href="http://jscal.sourceforge.net/">http://jscal.sourceforge.net/</a>.
<p>
Unfortunately this calendar
   only seems to work with Internet Explorer, so by default this option
   is not checked.
</ul>

Generated pages are written to the web application directory.
