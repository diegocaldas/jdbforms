     <para>Although you could try and do it via a pluggableEvent, as it currently stands Carlos Anjos points out that this can not be done and reminds us that:</para>
     
     <para>Apparently if a field is marked with isKey=&quot;true&quot; in the config file,
the preDelete and preUpdate methods disregard any changes to it.</para>
<para>I had a situation where I did some processing in the preDelete method
and then I wanted to allow the operation, but on a different row.
So I changed the values in the fieldValues hashtable, but still the
orginal row got deleted.</para>
<para>After banging my head for where in my code the error was, I finally
understood that dbforms was ignoring the change to that attribute.
A friend of mine went through dbforms deleteEvent code and confirmed
that.</para>
